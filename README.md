Women's Health and Wellness Advisor 

This is an AI-powered Womenâ€™s Health and Wellness App designed to predict PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) risk levels and offer personalized wellness recommendations based on user inputs like age, BMI, lifestyle habits, and symptoms.

ðŸš€ This project was developed as part of an Infosys Springboard iAccelerate Women's Hackathon under HEALTH & WELLNESS theme

Problem Statement
PCOS is a common yet underdiagnosed condition affecting women's health globally. Early prediction and lifestyle changes can help manage its impact. This app aims to provide an easy, accessible way to assess PCOS risk and promote wellness awareness.

#Key Features
 ML-Based Risk Prediction using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering
 Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for efficiency
 Personalized Recommendations based on risk assessment
 User-Friendly Frontend for easy input and result visualization
 Deployed with Flask API and hosted on Render

#Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask)
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Pandas
Deployment: Render, GitHub

#How It Works
-User inputs details like Age, Weight, Height, BMI, Exercise habits, and symptoms (Hair Loss, Pimples, Skin Darkening, Fast Food consumption).
