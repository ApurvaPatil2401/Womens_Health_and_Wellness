# Women's Health and Wellness Advisor 

This is an AI-powered Women’s Health and Wellness App designed to predict PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) risk levels and offer personalized wellness recommendations based on user inputs like age, BMI, lifestyle habits, and symptoms.

🚀 This project was developed as part of an Infosys Springboard iAccelerate Women's Hackathon under HEALTH & WELLNESS theme

## Problem Statement
PCOS is a common yet underdiagnosed condition affecting women's health globally. Early prediction and lifestyle changes can help manage its impact. This app aims to provide an easy, accessible way to assess PCOS risk and promote wellness awareness.

## Key Features
 ML-Based Risk Prediction using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering
 
 Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for efficiency
 
 Personalized Recommendations based on risk assessment
 
 User-Friendly Frontend for easy input and result visualization
 
 Deployed with Flask API and hosted on Render

## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ; 
Backend: Python (Flask) ; 
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Pandas ; 
Deployment: Render, GitHub

## How It Works
-User inputs details like Age, Weight, Height, BMI, Exercise habits, and symptoms (Hair Loss, Pimples, Skin Darkening, Fast Food consumption).
-The backend ML model predicts the PCOS risk level (Low, Moderate, High).
-Personalized health recommendations are provided based on the predicted risk.
